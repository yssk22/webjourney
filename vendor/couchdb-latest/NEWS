Version 0.4.0

   header parsing problems with oddly formed error messages.
 * Returned error messages are now logged at the server at the `info` level to
   make general debugging easier.
 * Fixed a problem where big table builds caused timeout errors.
 * Lots of changes in the low level machinery. Most formulas will continue to
   function the same.

 * Support for Perl/Ruby like regular expressions.

   there are multiple rows with identical startkeys.
 * The `skip` query string variable specifies the number of rows to skip before
   returning results. The `skip` value must be a positive integer. If used with
   a `count` variable the skipped rows aren't counted as output.
 * Various changes to the output XML format.
